   Begin with [`challenge_starter_template.ipynb`](challenge_starter_template.ipynb).

2. **Project Tasks**
   - **EDA:**  
     Check for missing values, distributions, duplicates, and review lengths. Visualize your findings.
   - **Preprocessing:**  
     Clean text (remove punctuation/stopwords, tokenize, lemmatize), convert to numerical features (e.g., TF-IDF), encode labels, and split data (use `random_state=42`).
   - **Model Building:**  
     Implement your sentiment classifier (using ML or deep learning methods).
   - **Evaluation:**  
     Report the F1 score and compare training vs. validation performance.
   - **Inferencing (Optional):**  
     Test your model on unseen data.
