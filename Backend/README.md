# Currency Converter Application

## Objective

Your task is to create a currency converter using the ExchangeRate-API. Documentation and necessary details can be found at [ExchangeRate-API Documentation](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/standard-requests).

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a free account at [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/sign-up). The free version allows for 1500 API calls per month.
- Obtain an API key for using ExchangeRate-API services. Remember to keep your API key confidential.
- Use PostgreSQL as the relational database. Sign up for a free plan (Tiny Turtle) at [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html).
- Choose your preferred programming language and framework.

## Tasks

1. Save all conversion rates from Omani Riyal (OMR) to other currencies every 3 minutes, along with the date and timestamp.
2. Create an API that retrieves all rates saved between OMR and one or more currencies, ordered by date.
3. Implement an API for converting between any two currencies, and save all conversions made by the user.
4. Develop an API that retrieves all user conversions for each currency, ordered by date.

## Notes

- This task focuses exclusively on backend development; no GUI is required.
- Use Postman or a similar tool for API testing.

## Extras
