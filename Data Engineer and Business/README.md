## Tasks

1. Fetch data from API and insert it into SQL Server database.
2. Sechedule the task to run automatically using CRON Job.
3. Visual the cryptocurrency data you have fetched from the CoinCap API using Python.

## Notes

- Focus is purely on Python for fetching data and visualization.
- The line graph, bar chart, and scatter plot use only the first 10 cryptocurrency coins while the donut chart uses the first 5 cryptocurrency coins.
- The values of visuals should exactly same as in the expected outcome sample.
