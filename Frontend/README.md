# Event Countdown

## Objective

Develop an Event Countdown web application allowing users to create events, with a comprehensive listing of these events each accompanied by a dynamic countdown timer.

## Prerequisites

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; no website builders.
- Optional frontend framework (e.g., React, Svelte, Vue).
- Choose a styling library (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI) or plain CSS.
- Utilize libraries for enhanced aesthetics (e.g., for Animation, consider Framer Motion).

## Tasks

1. **Home Page:** Display all added events with details and countdown timers.
2. **Event Creation Page:** Allow adding a new event with a photo, commence date and time, event name, and description. Store events in Local Storage for persistence.
3. Ensure website responsiveness across devices (laptop, tablet, mobile phone).

## Notes

- Focus is purely on Frontend; no APIs required.

## Extras

- Consider Dockerizing the application.
